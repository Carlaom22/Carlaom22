```python
def my_life():
    while True:
        try:
            code()
        except BurnoutError:
            coffee()
            meme()

## 🚧 Projects in Public View (the good ones)

| Project              | Description                                      | Status       |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| `404_project`        | I swear this was working yesterday               | ⚠️ Under evaluation |

## 🤡 Fun Facts

- My `main()` has no purpose... just like this section
- I use `print("debug")` instead of a debugger — elite stuff
- My favorite design pattern is `"it works, don’t touch it"`
- My `README.md` is better than some of my actual projects
